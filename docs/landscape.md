# Landscape Analysis — Agent Orchestration & Framework Components

**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Purpose:** Scout the gold standard for each Agent OS component before building. "What can we build FROM?"

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Frameworks

### Tier 1: Strong foundations (TypeScript, active, directly usable)

**Mastra** — github.com/mastra-ai/mastra
- 22.1k stars | Active March 2026 | TypeScript 99%
- Graph-based workflow engine with `.then()`, `.branch()`, `.parallel()` DSL
- First-class suspend/resume for human-in-the-loop
- Zod-validated step inputs/outputs. 40+ model providers. MCP server support.
- **Agent OS relevance:** HIGH — could be workflow/harness foundation (Layers 1-3). Suspend/resume maps to trust tier pausing. Parallel groups map to `.parallel()`.
- **Limitation:** Enterprise features are paid. Monolithic — you adopt its opinions. No built-in trust tiers or maker-checker.

**Paperclip** — github.com/paperclipai/paperclip
- 28.1k stars | Active March 2026 | TypeScript 96%
- Heartbeat cycle (wake, execute, sleep). Adapter interface (`invoke/status/cancel`). Atomic task checkout. Budget controls. Immutable audit log. Governance rollback.
- **Agent OS relevance:** HIGH — architecture spec already borrows from it heavily (Layer 2). Working reference implementation.
- **Limitation:** Uses PostgreSQL. Full platform, not a library. React UI tightly coupled.

**Claude Agent SDK** — `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` on npm
- 5.5k stars (Python SDK) | Active March 2026
- Programmatic Claude Code orchestration. Custom tools as MCP servers. Hooks for intercepting tool use. Subagents and session forking.
- **Agent OS relevance:** HIGH for Layer 2. This is how we'd invoke Claude Code as an adapter. Hooks map to harness interception.
- **Limitation:** Claude-specific. JS SDK is CLI wrapper, not full agent SDK.

### Tier 2: Right concepts, wrong ecosystem

**LangGraph** — 26.7k stars | Python only
- Durable execution, graph interrupts for HITL, memory systems. Good conceptual model but can't use directly.

**CrewAI** — 46.4k stars | Python only
- YAML-based config, role-based collaboration. Validates our YAML approach but opposite philosophy (autonomous crews vs trust-first).

**OpenAI Agents SDK** — 20.1k stars | Python only
- Guardrails concept loosely maps to harness. Conversation-oriented, not process-oriented.

**AG2 (formerly AutoGen)** — 4.3k stars | Python only
- UserProxyAgent for HITL. Reviewer-agent patterns validate maker-checker concept.

## Workflow / Process Engines

**Trigger.dev** — github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev
- 14.1k stars | Active March 2026 | TypeScript 98%
- Purpose-built for AI agent workflows. Durable execution, no timeouts. Waitpoint tokens for HITL. Supports all 5 Anthropic agent patterns.
- **Agent OS relevance:** HIGH alternative for Layer 2. Waitpoint tokens = trust-tier pause mechanism.
- **Limitation:** Requires infrastructure (cloud or self-hosted). Heavier than SQLite + cron.

**Inngest** — github.com/inngest/inngest
- 5k+ stars | Active March 2026 | Go server, TypeScript SDK
- Step-based durable execution. Event-driven triggers. AgentKit for multi-agent networks. `step.ai.wrap()` for reliable LLM calls.
- **Agent OS relevance:** HIGH — step-based execution maps to process steps. TypeScript-first SDK.
- **Limitation:** Requires Inngest server. SSPL license.

**Temporal** — TypeScript SDK 789 stars
- Industrial-grade. Activity heartbeats. Conceptually perfect but requires Java server. Overkill for dogfood.

**BullMQ** — 8.6k stars
- Parent/child job dependencies. Requires Redis. Job-oriented, not workflow-oriented.

## Projects from Architecture Spec Borrowing Table

**antfarm** — github.com/snarktank/antfarm
- 2.2k stars | Active Feb 2026 | TypeScript 71%
- YAML workflow definitions + SQLite state + cron-based polling. Independent verification agents. 7-agent pipelines.
- **Agent OS relevance:** Core reference for Layers 1, 3. "Developer doesn't mark own homework" = maker-checker. Closest existing implementation to process + harness model.

**ralph** — github.com/snarktank/ralph
- 13.1k stars | Active Jan 2026 | TypeScript 63%
- Autonomous loop with fresh context per iteration. Three-tier state: git history + progress.txt + prd.json.
- **Agent OS relevance:** Core reference for Layer 2 execution model. Validates flat-file state and zero-setup approach.

**gstack** — github.com/garrytan/gstack
- 21k stars | Active March 2026 | TypeScript 75%
- 13 specialized agent roles via slash commands. 80-item design audits. Browser-based testing.
- **Agent OS relevance:** Reference for Layers 2, 3. Role diversity validates our role-based system prompts.

**compound-product** — github.com/snarktank/compound-product
- 499 stars | Active Jan 2026 | Shell + JSON
- Self-improving product system. Analyse → identify priority → create PRD → execute → deliver PR.
- **Agent OS relevance:** Reference for Layer 5 and Self-Improvement Meta-Process.

## Storage, CLI, and Infrastructure

### Storage
| Option | Stars | Fit | Notes |
|--------|-------|-----|-------|
| **better-sqlite3** | 4.6k dependents | Best | Synchronous, fast, mature. Drizzle supports it. Swap driver, keep schema. |
| **Turso/libSQL** | - | Future | Local-first with optional cloud sync. Consider when scaling beyond single machine. |
| **Node.js built-in sqlite** | - | Watch | Experimental in Node 22.5+. Not production-ready yet. |
| **lowdb** | 21k | Config only | No query engine. Good for simple key-value, not transactional data. |
| **conf** | - | Config | Platform-correct config dir. Good for API keys, preferences. |

**Recommendation:** Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 for structured data. conf for user config.

### CLI
| Option | Stars | Fit | Notes |
|--------|-------|-----|-------|
| **@clack/prompts** | 5.1k dependents | Best (UX) | Beautiful prompts. Used by Astro, Svelte scaffolders. Perfect for approve/edit/reject. |
| **citty** (UnJS) | - | Best (routing) | TypeScript-first, ESM, minimal. Great type inference. |
| **Commander.js** | 27k | Established | Most widely used. Less TypeScript-native than citty. |
| **Ink** | - | Overkill | React for terminals. Too heavy for our needs. |
| **oclif** | - | Overkill | Enterprise-grade. Significant boilerplate. |

**Recommendation:** citty (command routing) + @clack/prompts (interactive UX).

## What's Genuinely Ours to Build

No existing framework implements these — they are Agent OS's unique value:

1. **Progressive trust tiers** — supervised → spot-checked → autonomous, earned through track record. Every framework is binary (human checks everything, or nothing).
2. **Trust earning with data** — approval rates, correction rates, review cycles driving upgrade suggestions.
3. **Process-first model** — every framework is agent-first or task-first. Process as the primitive is original.
4. **Implicit feedback capture** — edits-as-feedback, correction pattern extraction from diffs.
5. **Explore → Operate transition** — conversation crystallising into process definition.
6. **Governance function** — agents providing cross-cutting compliance assurance across individuals, teams, organisations.
7. **Agent authentication** — identity, permissions, and provenance for agents entering the harness.

## Pragmatic Path for Dogfood

For the coding agent team (first implementation):

- **Adopt antfarm's pattern:** YAML + SQLite + sequential execution with verification gates
- **Adopt ralph's state model:** Flat files for context, git for history
- **Adopt Paperclip's adapter interface:** `invoke()` / `status()` / `cancel()`
- **Use Drizzle + better-sqlite3:** Swap driver, keep existing schema structure
- **Use citty + @clack/prompts:** Modern TypeScript CLI stack
- **Build our own:** Trust tier enforcement, maker-checker harness, feedback capture, governance
- **Defer infrastructure** (Inngest/Trigger.dev/Mastra) to when durable execution at scale is needed
